有一种常见但不安全的加密文本的方法, 是将字母表中的某个字母固定地取代另一个字母.

为了保证加密是可逆的, 没有两个字母会被同一个字母取代.

你的任务是要解密几行文本. 这几行文本在被加密的时候可能每一行都使用了不同的取代方案, 而且所有的单词都来自一个已知的词典.


输入：

输入文件包含多行. 第一行是一个整数n, 表示词典中单词的数量.
第二行开始是n个单词, 每行一个单词.
解密后的明文中的所有单词都是由这些单词组成的.
在单词之后, 是若干行密文. 每一行都是按上述方式加密的.

词典的大小小于1000. 单词不超过16个字母.
加密前后的字母都只有小写. 每一行不超过80字母.

输出：

解密每一行密文, 并打印明文. 如果有多种可能的明文, 输出任何一个即可.
如果没有可能的明文, 用星号来取代每一个字母.

the house of representatives has already passed a bill hardening iran sanctions but the senate agreed to delay further action to allow diplomacy a chance to succeed

kerry is likely to argue for a further delay to cover the next round of talks sources said

but senate foreign relations committee chairman robert menendez sounded taken aback by the white house warning

thats pretty alarmist over the top he told afp

republican senator richard shelby said that the white house warnings over the impact of new sanctions were wrong

we dont know how sincere yet the iranians are in our whole negotiations he said

senator michael crapo the top republican on the banking committee told afp he believes the senate should move aggressively forward on our sanctions legislation although he said he was willing to listen to kerrys arguments wednesday and his details on the geneva negotiations

republican senator pat toomey told afp that really tough sanctions were the only way to bring iran to the table in a meaningful way and get them to agree to end their program

colin kahl director of the middle east security program at the center for a new american security said congress was warming to the idea that sanctions pressure got iran to the negotiating table and more pressure will get them over the goal line

but trita parsi president of the national iranian american council said new sanctions could seriously limit rouhanis ability to maintain his soft position on the negotiations
